# Mass-Mail-Dispatcher
A mass mail dispatcher project in web development typically involves building a system that allows users to send bulk emails to a large number of recipients. This type of project is commonly used in email marketing, newsletter distribution, and communication with a large user base. Designed this website using HTML,CSS Jvascript during my one month internship in EXPOSYS DATA LABS.
